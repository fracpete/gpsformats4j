GPS format conversions in Java.

Very simple, very hacky. ;-) The main reason was to be able to convert
TCX files exported from a proprietary app into GPX ones so the OsmAnd app 
can display them.

## Supported formats

Currently the following formats are supported:

* CSV
* [GPX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format)
* [TCX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_Center_XML)
